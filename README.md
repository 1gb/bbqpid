I used [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app]
and [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0]


*Dev Setup*
`yarn` or `yarn install` in both the root folder and `/client`
then `yarn dev` in the root to start it up!
